# Maisie-s-Portfolio

This is my very first version of my personal portfolio. I have a header with nagivation links to each of my three main sections, a section with one of my catchphrases, a projects section, about section, and contact me section, each of water are linked from the header. I also have a footer with the month and date my portfoio is last updated so my viewers can gauage it's recency. For now I do not have any projects to include so I have used images of roses that link to google.com, and I will update these links with projects as I carry forward. I am not sure what the problem with my selfie is, it works locally but is not loading after initializing into GitHub. At this time, it is only desktop friendly, and I will need to add media-queries to ensure it is viewable from all devices. I think I went about it backwards by designing it dekstop friendly.
